I am passionate about creating human-centered, accessible technologies that address the challenges faced by individuals with disabilities. My research focuses on assistive mobility devices and technologies, aiming to empower people with hemiplegia and visual impairments to navigate everyday environments more independently and confidently.

Current Research:

Assistive Mobility for people with Hemiplegia:

I am currently working on a project dedicated to developing assistive mobility solutions for individuals with hemiplegia. This research focuses on designing tools that help users navigate crowded environments, considering factors such as spatial awareness, ease of use, and adaptability. Collaborating with three professors, my work emphasizes human-centric design, combining engineering principles with user feedback to ensure the technology serves the specific needs of the hemiplegic community.

Goal: Enhance mobility and accessibility for individuals with hemiplegia in crowded environments.
Impact: Providing independence and improving quality of life by making mobility smoother and safer.

Past Research:
Caper: A tool that helps analyse network traffic


Technology for Visually Impaired Individuals (National University of Singapore): 

During my research internship at the National University of Singapore, I developed a device to assist visually impaired individuals. The project involved creating a navigation tool that gives feedback to individuals when it detects objects and makes them aware of potential obstacles and offers assistance in real-time. This work allowed me to explore the intersection of artificial intelligence and assistive technology, and it played a pivotal role in sparking my interest in accessibility research.

Goal: Improve navigation and independence for visually impaired individuals through technology.
Impact: Contributed to the development of solutions that support safer and more autonomous movement.
